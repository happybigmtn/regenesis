# Personal Website & Development Playground

My personal website and development playground built with SvelteKit and Sanity.io. This project serves as both my portfolio and a learning space where I experiment with webtech.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit
- **CMS**: Sanity.io

## Project Structure

```
regenesisdev/
├── dev-portfolio/     # SvelteKit frontend application
└── studio-portfolio/  # Sanity Studio (CMS) configuration
```

This is a monorepo setup where the frontend and CMS live side by side, making it easier to manage both codebases together.
